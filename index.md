## Section 13F securities list in Excel

### About this website

<p>I was amazed in learning that the SEC doesn't publish the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13flists">list of Section 13(f) Securities</a> in any format other than PDF.</p>
<p>After seeing many websites trying to sell the list in .xlsx format, I made my own extract solution in R and decided to leave it here for free.</p>

### About the file
<p>Although I had put an effort in making sure everything is ok, please use with caution.</p>
